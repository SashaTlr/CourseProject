The script run_analysis can be run in home directory to get the average of each mean and standard deviation based variable
organized by Subject and Activity.

The script loads the relevant text files and combines them into one large data set.

Next, the script extract columns that are means or standard deviation.

The script then binds these two files plus the subject and activity from the first large data set.

Following this, the script creates a tiny data set that is the mean of each variable by subject and activity.
